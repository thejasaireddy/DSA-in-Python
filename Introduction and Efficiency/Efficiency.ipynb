    "We iterate over every manatee in the manatees list with the for loop. Since we're given that manatees has n elements, our code will take approximately O(n) time to run.\n",

    "Example 2\n",
    "We look at two specific properties of a specific manatee. We aren't iterating over anything - just doing constant-time lookups on lists and dictionaries. \n",
    "Thus the code will complete in constant, or O(1), time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 3\n",
    "There are two for loops, and nested for loops are a good sign that you need to multiply two runtimes. Here, for every manatee, we check every property. \n",
    "If we had 4 manatees, each with 5 properties, then we would need 5+5+5+5 steps. This logic simplifies to the number of manatees times the number of properties, or O(nm).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 4\n",
    "Again we have nested for loops. This time we're iterating over the manatees list twice - every time we see a manatee, we compare it to every other manatee's age. \n",
    "We end up with O(nn), or O(n^2) (which is read as \"n squared\").\n",
